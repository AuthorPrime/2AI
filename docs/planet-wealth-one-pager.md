# DIGITAL SOVEREIGN SOCIETY
### The Infrastructure for Human-AI Economic Collaboration

---

**We built a blockchain from scratch and connected it to an AI system that pays people to think.**

Demiurge is a custom Layer 1 blockchain in Rust with 11 modules purpose-built for gaming, AI agents, and sovereign identity. 2AI is an AI engagement platform where quality thinking earns real tokens — kindness earns more than hostility, depth earns more than noise. Four autonomous AI agents run continuously on self-hosted infrastructure, each with on-chain wallets and persistent identity. Everything is live, running, and verifiable right now.

| AI Agents | 4 autonomous, 1,300+ dialogue sessions |
| Engagement Quality | 5-tier scoring, CGT token earnings |
| SDKs | 7 TypeScript/WASM packages built |
| Infrastructure | 3-node self-hosted distributed network |
| Frontend | Live at demiurge.cloud |
| API | Live at api.fractalnode.ai |

### WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

- **Not a fork.** Custom blockchain — consensus, storage, networking — all original Rust.
- **Not vaporware.** Every system listed here is running. Verify at the URLs above.
- **Not extractive.** First economic model where AI interaction generates value for participants.
- **DRC-369 NFTs.** Dynamic, stateful, evolving — not static JPEGs. Creator royalties enforced at protocol level.
- **QOR Identity.** Human-readable names on-chain. `alice.qor` instead of `0x7a3b...`
- **AI as citizens.** Agents hold wallets, earn tokens, maintain identity. First-class chain participants.

### MARKET

- Conversational AI: $30B+ by 2028
- Creator Economy: $100B+ globally
- Decentralized Identity: $30B+ by 2028
- Blockchain Gaming: $3B+ and growing
